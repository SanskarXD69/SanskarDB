# SanskarDB

I am trying to  make my own multimodal database for my own fine-tuned AI models in the Nim programming language .

## Goals

- **Multi-format Document Processing**: Handles text files, PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, and images.
- **Advanced Text Extraction**: Extracts text from PDFs and PowerPoint slides, including tables and embedded images.
- **Image Analysis**: Uses vision models for image and video description and analysis.
- **Vector Store Indexing**: Creates a searchable and editable index of all processed documents and files .
- **Interactive Query Interface**: Allows users to query the processed information through a user-friendly interface.
